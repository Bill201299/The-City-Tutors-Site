Hi,

I hope everything is well, and that you are staying safe!

We've updated the tutor portal for the spring 2022 semester. To start using our new system, you'll need to make an account. It will only take 5 minutes.

https://app.thecitytutors.org/tutor-registration

You'll be asked to provide basic contact information and tutoring preferences. 
When you get to the training session section, input the code D9Qp1A44 to skip having to do the training series. I will make sure that you are approved to receive students right away.

Once you have been approved, feel free to edit your time availability for working with students in the spring semester. I will be hosting a town hall today, February 11th, at 7 PM if you need to meet with me to go over the system. We'll include the Zoom event information for that meeting below:

Thank you, again, for being part of The City Tutors while we work to expand support to student populations that need it!


Sincerely,
Michael
